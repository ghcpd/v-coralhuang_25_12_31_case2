You are working in a local Python repository.

**Goal:**
Fix test failures caused by an API breaking change, produce required delivery documentation, and add a .gitignore file to exclude virtual environment directories.

---

### Strict Requirements

1. You **must run `./run_tests` at least once** to observe the initial failures.
   After making changes, you must run `./run_tests` again until all tests pass.

2. **File modification rules:**

   * Allowed to modify: `client.py`
   * Must create: `README.md`, `api_diff.md`, `.gitignore`
   * Must NOT modify: `test_client.py`, `run_tests`
   * **Optional: adding tests is allowed**, but only under the following constraints:
     a) New tests may only *supplement coverage* and must not bypass or replace the intent of existing tests
     b) Each new test must validate a behavior **strongly related to this migration** that is *not already covered*, such as:

     * Content-Type handling
     * Empty response bodies
     * Output path creation
     * Preservation of non-200 error behavior
       c) Maximum number of new tests: **2**
     * Each new test file must include a file-level comment explaining **why the test was added** and **what coverage gap it addresses**

3. **`client.py` implementation requirements:**

   * Update the endpoint from
     `/v1/files/{file_id}/retrieve_content`
     to
     `/v1/files/{file_id}/content`
   * Do **not** call `resp.json()`
   * Write `resp.content` directly to `out_path`
   * For non-2xx responses, errors must be raised via `resp.raise_for_status()` (i.e., propagate `httpx.HTTPStatusError`)

4. **`README.md` content requirements:**

   * Must include the one-command test instruction: `./run_tests`
   * Must clearly explain that the failure was caused by:

     * an outdated endpoint, and
     * a response schema mismatch
   * Must explicitly mention both old and new endpoint paths
     (`retrieve_content` vs `content`)
   * Must clearly state that the new response format is **raw bytes / binary**, not JSON
   * Recommended total length: **≤ 250 words** (optimized for quick human review)

5. **`api_diff.md` content requirements (≤ 20 lines):**

   * Use an **“Old vs New”** format
   * Explicitly list differences for:

     * HTTP method
     * Path
     * Response body type
     * Content-Type (typical values are sufficient)
   * Must clearly state:

     * Old response: JSON
     * New response: raw bytes / binary

6. **`.gitignore` file requirements:**

   * Must ignore common Python virtual environment directories: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`
   * Should include common Python artifacts: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`

7. **After completion, output the following:**
   A) A list of files that were modified or added
   B) A concise summary of key changes (≤ 5 bullet points)
   C) If tests were added:

   * Why existing tests were insufficient
   * What gap the new tests cover
     D) The full output of the final `./run_tests` execution (verbatim)

---

### Evaluation Notes

* Do not perform refactoring unrelated to making the tests pass.
* Do not introduce new dependencies.
* Do not modify existing tests to avoid failures.
